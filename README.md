# Wordpress

I don't use Wordpress these days, or much of MySQL, but needed to create a theme for a friend recently. This helped me spin up a local dev environment 'real quick'.

## Running locally

Based on https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/ the docker compose file in this directory, run:

```
docker-compose up --build
// I have an alias 'dcub'
```
